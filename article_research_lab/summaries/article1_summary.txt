Here are three bullet points summarizing the article about global warming:

• The Earth's average surface air temperature has increased by almost 1.5 °C (about 2.5 °F) since the Industrial Revolution, with natural forces causing some variability but human activities being the primary driver of this increase.

• Climate change is having a significant impact on the environment, including the expansion of deserts, heat waves, and wildfires, as well as more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes, with many species being forced to relocate or become extinct due to rapid environmental change.

• The current trajectory for warming suggests that global temperatures are likely to exceed 1.5 °C by the mid-2030s, with future projections indicating that warming could reach 2.8 °C (5.0 °F) by the end of the century under a low-emissions scenario, and potentially much higher temperatures in high-emissions scenarios, making it essential to limit global warming to 1.5 °C or below to avoid severe consequences.

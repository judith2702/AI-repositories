Here are three bullet points summarizing the article about auroras:

• An aurora is a natural light display in Earth's sky, predominantly observed in high-latitude regions around the Arctic and Antarctic, caused by disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere triggered by solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections.

• Auroras display dynamic patterns of radiant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky, with colors ranging from red to blue, green, yellow, and pink, depending on altitude, intensity, and solar activity. The forms of auroras can be mild glows near the horizon, patches, arcs, rays, coronas, or curtains.

• Auroras are influenced by Earth's magnetic field, changing over time with solar activity, and can change their appearances and intensity rapidly or slowly, sometimes even producing pulsating or subvisual effects. The phenomenon of auroras is closely tied to geomagnetic storms, which can expand the auroral oval, bringing the aurora to lower latitudes or higher in the south, and are often accompanied by radio emissions, X-ray emissions, and other forms of radiation.

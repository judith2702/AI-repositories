Here are 3 bullet points summarizing the article about soft serve ice cream:

• Soft serve, also known as soft ice, is a type of frozen dessert that is softer and less dense than traditional ice cream due to the introduction of air during freezing. It has been sold commercially since the late 1930s in the United States and is commonly found at fairs, carnivals, amusement parks, and restaurants.

• The origin of soft serve ice cream is disputed between Tom Carvel, who developed a secret formula in 1936, and J.F. McCullough, who claimed to have invented it in 1938 near Moline, Illinois. Other countries also claim to have developed their own versions of soft serve, with different names and variations.

• Soft serve ice cream is characterized by its lower milk-fat content (3-6%) compared to traditional ice cream (10-18%), as well as a higher air content that can vary from 0-60%. The ideal air content is between 33-45% of volume, and the product must be frozen quickly to prevent crystal growth. Different countries use various terms to describe soft serve, such as "creemee" in Vermont, "crème glacée molle" in Quebec, or "Mr. Whippy" in the UK.
